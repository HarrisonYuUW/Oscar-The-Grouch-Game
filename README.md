# Oscar-The-Grouch-Game
A game created for inspirational and educational purposes. Inspired by Space Invaders. Focusing on OOP in pygame. 
The main code is posted, to run the game you must download the zip and ensure you have pygame installed. 

This game was created in order to provide an example to teach hundreds of students and hundreds more in the future. It is provided for the organization K-4-STEM as well as future CS courses within DPCDSB. It combines the utilization of pygame and OOP to give a fun and hands-on way to learn more advanced concepts of programming. The ultimate goal of the organizations I have founded is to inspire young intelligent minds to pursue areas of knowledge that I wished I had pursued when I was younger. As the famous proverb goes, "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."
